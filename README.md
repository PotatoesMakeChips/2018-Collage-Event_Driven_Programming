# Event Driven Programming 
This was my first programming modal at college it's a basic multiple choice quiz with music and help-page integration. Coded in Visual Basic it's a simple demo of event-driven programming in an application that's well suited to it. I wouldn't use visual basic again by choice but it does make it incredibly easy to make simple apps like this very quickly.
